Stem and Leaf
E.g:
60, 61, 72, 73, 84, 85
Stem | Leaf
6    | 0 1
7    | 2 3
8    | 4 5

Box Plot
H-spread = Q3 - Q1
Step = 1.5 * H-spread
Upper inner fence = Q3 + Step
Lower inner fence = Q1 - Step
If max/min exceed range upper-lower, outlier

Trimean
(Q1 + 2 * Median + Q3) / 4

Geometric Mean
Add all percentage by 1
GM = root by the number of years sqr(multiply all the percentage that’s already been added 1)
Convert GM back to percentage by -1

Trimmed Mean
Let’s say, 10 data and given trimmed mean by 10%
Remove 10% of 10 is 1, so remove 1 data from top and bottom
So remove min and max
Calculate mean as per usual

Hypergeometric Formula
Probability for successes when draws are made without replacements
p = ( kCx (N-k)C(n-x) ) / NCn
N = Total population
k = Total of the one we want
n = Amount selected
x = Amount we want
E.g:
A bag contains 10 red balls and 15 blue balls. if you randomly select 5 balls without replacement, what is the probability that exactly 3 of the selected balls are red?
N = 25
k = 10
n = 5
x = 3
Then just put in the formula

Binomial Distribution - Probability
P(x = ?) = ( N! / x!(N-x)! ) * pi^x * ( 1 - pi )^N-x
N = Number of trials
x = Number of successes
pi = Probability of a success
E.g:
Calculate the probability of getting exactly 3 heads when flipping a fair coin 5 times (where getting heads is considered a success)
N = 5
x = 3
pi = 0.5
Then just put in the formula
E.g:
In a basketball game, a player has a free throw success rate of 80%. If the player takes 15 free throws, what is the probability that they make at least 12 successful free throws?
P(x ≥ 12) = P(x = 12) + P(x = 13) + P(x = 14) + P(x = 15)

Pearson's Correlation Coefficient
Formula = (∑xy)/√(∑x^2∑y^2)
Given the table columns are X and Y
x = X - X mean
y = Y - Y mean
E.g:
      X  Y  x  y  xy  x^2  y^2
      2 10 -4 -10 40 16 100
      4 15 -2 -5 10 4 25
      6 20 0 0 0 0 0
      8 25 2 5 10 4 25
      10 30 4 10 40 16 100
Total 30 100 0 0 100 40 250
Mean   6 20 0 0
Calculating
r = (∑xy)/√(∑x^2∑y^2) = 100/√(40 * 250)

Standard Deviation
1. Calculate mean
2. Deviation of each score = Each data - mean
3. Squared deviations = Square each of the deviation of each score
4. Variance = Mean of squared deviations
5. Standard deviation = square root (sqr) of variance

Z-Table
Given n p q:
n = Number of samples
p = Probability of success
q = Probability of failure (1-p)
1. Get n p q
2. Check conditions:
   n * p > 5
   n * q > 5
   If both > 5, normal approximation can be used
3. Calculate mean = np
4. Calculate standard deviation = sqr(npq)
5. Continuity correction (-0.5) for P(x < ?)
   E.g:
   Suppose a survey indicates that 30% of people prefer coffee over tea. If you randomly select 100 people, what is the probability that fewer than 25 people prefer coffee? Use z-table
   We want P(x < 25) so continuity correction is P(x <= 24.5)
6. Standardize (from example):
   Z = (24.5 - 30) / Standard deviation
7. Find z-score in z-table, that's the probability
Probability in z-table always P(Z <= ?)
For P(Z => ?), just 1 - P(x <= ?)

T-Test
One-tailed = Mention either increase or decrease
Two-tailed = Change, can be increase or decrease, difference
Null hypothesis (H0) = No significant difference
Alternative hypothesis (H1) = Claim being made
1. State hypotheses
2. Calculate mean
3. Calculate standard deviation (use online calculator, sample)
4. T-statistic formula = ( Mean - Assumed mean ) / ( Standard deviation / sqr( Sample size )
5. Degrees of freedom = Sample size - 1
6. T-table for df and a, obtain critical value +-
7. If t-statistic is within range of +- critical value, fail to reject null hypothesis

Paired T-Test
1. Obtain differences d
2. Calculate mean of d
3. Calculate sd of d = sqr( sum of (di - mean) / sample size - 1 )
4. T-statistic = Mean / (sd / sqr(sample size))
5. If < critical, reject null

Independent T-Test
State hypothesis
Given 2 groups
E.g:
Group                 Sample Size (n) Mean Weight Loss (x) Standard Deviation (s)
Group A (New)         25              8 kg                 2
Group B (Standard)    25              6 kg                 2.5
T-statistic formula = (xA - xB) / sqr((sA^2 / nA) + (sB^2 / nB))
Degrees of freedom = nA + nB - 2
If t > critical, reject
But be careful with the question

One-Way ANOVA Test
State hypothesis
1. Calculate grand mean
2. Calculate group means
3. Total sum of squares (SST) = (data - grand mean)^2 + (data - grand mean)^2 + ... + (data - grand mean)^2 -> For literally ALL
4. Between-Groups Sum of Squares (SSB) = rows * ((group mean - grand mean)^2 + (group mean - grand mean)^2 + ... + (group mean - grand mean)^2)
   Rows is the number of samples for each group, usually same number
5. Within-Groups Sum of Squares (SSW) = SST - SSB
6. Degree of freedom (df)
   dfbetween = columns - 1
   dfwithin = Total sample - columns
7. Mean squares (MS)
   MSbetween = SSB/dfB
   MSwithin = SSW/dfW
8. F-statistic = MSB/MSW
9. Find critical value with dfB and dfW
10. If > critical, reject null

Chi-Square Test
State hypothesis
1. Expected frequency = (Row total * Column total) / Grand total
2. Replace each cell in the table with expected frequency
3. For each cell = (Original - Expected)^2 / Expected
4. Sum everything from 3 -> Chi-square value
5. Degrees of freedom (df) = (Rows - 1) * (Columns - 1)
   If x^2 ≤ critical, fail to reject H0

Two-Way ANOVA Test
State hypothesis
1. Calculate grand mean
2. Find mean for row, column, and each cell
3. Sum of squares
   Per row (SSA):
   Total sample per row * (Mean of row - Grand mean)^2 + Total sample per row * (Mean of row - Grand mean)^2 + ... + Total sample per row * (Mean of row - Grand mean)^2
   Per column (SSB):
   Total sample per column * (Mean of column - Grand mean)^2 + Total sample per column * (Mean of column - Grand mean)^2 + ... + Total sample per column * (Mean of column - Grand mean)^2
   Sum of squares within error (SSE):
   For each data in the cell, (data1 - average of that cell)^2 + (data2 - average of that cell)^2 + ... + (data - average of that cell)^2
   Total of all (SSTotal): Total of SSEs
   SSInteraction = SSTotal – SSA – SSB – SSE
   dfA = Number of rows - 1
   dfB = Number of columns - 1
   dfinteraction = dfA * dfB
   dfwithin = Total samples - cells
   dfTotal= dfA + dfB + dfI + dfW
4. Mean squares (MS):
   MSA = SSA/dfA
   MSB = SSB/dfB
   MSAB = SSI/dfI
   MSE = SSE/dfW
5. FFF-statistics:
   FA = MSA/MSE
   FB = MSB/MSE
   FAB = MSAB/MSE
6. Critical values:
   A use FA and df (dfA, dfW)
   B use FB and df (dfB, dfW)
   Interaction use FAB and df (dfI, dfW)
7. If F > critical, reject null
   
THE END GOOD LUCK HAVE FUN
